<p class="writing">This dish started after the Korean War when food was in short supply.</p>
<p class="writing">Canned ham, hot dogs, and beans were taken from American military bases and mixed with traditional Korean kimchi, vegetables, noodles, and spicy seasonings 
    to create a delicious spicy and hearty stew.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Ingredients</h2>
<ul class="list">
    <li>1 (12 oz) can fully cooked luncheon meat (SPAM), sliced</li>
